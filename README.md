[Phil's](http://pzross.com) personal R functions

I don't currently see these functions as having any utility to anyone aside from myself so they are not officially submitted to CRAN but you should be able to install them using devtools.

## Installation

Installation should be straight forward. First, install the dependencies, then run the commands to install the package directly from Github.

**Dependencies:**

* [servr](https://github.com/yihui/servr)
* [knitcitations](https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations)

**Commands:**

1. devtools::install_github("thephilross/iver")
